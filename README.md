# Test Automation

## Overview

I will use:

- **Test Framework**: WebdriverIO with Mocha framework using JavaScript.
- **Design Pattern**: Page Object Model (POM).
- **Best Practices**: Modularized code, reusable utilities, clean assertions, and proper naming conventions.
- **Parallel Execution**: Configured in **wdio.conf.js**.
- **Reporting**: Integrated Allure reporting.

### Explanation of Folders:

- **`allure-results/`**: This folder stores the raw results generated by the WebDriverIO test execution. These are typically JSON files that contain details about each test run. Allure uses these results to generate the final test report.
- **`allure-report/`**: This folder contains the generated Allure test report, which is an HTML-based report that provides detailed and interactive views of the test results. You can open `index.html` in any browser to view the report.
- **`node_modules/`**: Contains all the installed npm dependencies required for the project. This folder is automatically created when you run `npm install`.

- **`tests/`**: This is the main folder containing all the test-related files and directories.

  - **`pageobjects/`**: Contains the Page Object Model (POM) files, which abstract interactions with different pages or components of the application. Each page object represents a UI page, and its methods provide functionality to interact with that page.
  - **`specs/`**: This directory contains the test specifications (spec files), which define the actual test cases for the application. Each test file contains individual tests that use page objects to perform actions and assertions.
    - Example: `addToCartAndCheckoutTest.e2e`, `registerNewAccountTest.e2e.js`
  - **`utilities/`**: Contains utility functions that are commonly used across the tests. This might include custom commands, hooks, or common functions to simplify or streamline test code.

- **`wdio.conf.js`**: This is the WebDriverIO configuration file, where you define settings such as parallel test execution, test runner options, and reporter configuration.

- **`package.json`**: Contains metadata about the project, including the list of dependencies and scripts like `chrome-test` and `edge-test` for running tests and `generate-report` for generating the Allure report.

- **`package-lock.json`**: This file locks the specific versions of the dependencies installed in the project, ensuring consistency across environments.

---

### Summary:

- **`tests/pageobjects/`**: Contains Page Object Model files that define interactions with UI pages or components.
- **`tests/specs/`**: Contains test specification files that define the actual tests.
- **`tests/utilities/`**: Contains utility/helper files for reusability and custom functions across tests.

This folder structure ensures that your tests are well-organized, reusable, and maintainable.

## Features

- **Cross browser test Execution**: we can run the scripts by chrome or edge browser.
- **Allure Reporting**: Provides detailed and interactive test reports for better insights into test execution.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Enhances maintainability and reusability of test scripts by abstracting the UI interactions.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install

   ```

2. Execute all scripts

- **Run in Chrome**

  ```
  npm run chrome-test

  ```

- **Run in Edge**

  ```
   npm run edge-test

  ```

3. After execution, Need to generate allure report.

   ```
   npm run generate-report

   ```

- **Viewing the Report**: You can view the report by Navigate to allure-report folder and click index.html file.

The structure and explanations are provided in a step-by-step manner to ensure users can easily follow the process from running tests to generating and viewing the report.

## Folder Structure
